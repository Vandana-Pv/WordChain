# MyFitness Google Action 

WordChain is a simple game played between Alexa and Users. Alexa gives a random word and the user should say a word that starts with the last letter of the word given by Alexa. In the next turn Alexa says a word that starts with the last letter of the word given by User and the game continues.

## Architecture

The action consists of two basic parts, a front end and a back end. The front end is the voice interface, or VUI. The voice interface is configured through the **Alexa Developer Console**. The back end is where the logic of the action resides and is hosted in **Amazon Web Services** using **Lambda** .
